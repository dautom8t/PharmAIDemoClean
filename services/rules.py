"""
Rules engine for the PharmAI middleware.

Rules encapsulate payer, plan or clinical logic that determine when certain
workflow transitions or tasks should occur.  Each rule has a `condition`
expression that evaluates to a boolean, and an `action` expression that
executes when the condition is True.  Both expressions are stored as strings
in the database.  When evaluating rules, these expressions are executed
dynamically in a restricted environment.

⚠️ **Security Notice**: Executing code from the database is dangerous.  In a
real implementation you should use a safe expression language or DSL instead
of Python `eval`/`exec`.  This demonstration uses Python for brevity.
